Changelog
=========


2.1.0 (2017-08-31)
------------------

New features:

- support IPv6


2.0.1 (2012-04-06)
------------------

Bugs Fixed

- Sending data faster than a socket could transmit it wasn't handled
  correctly.

2.0.0 (2011-12-10)
------------------

Bugs Fixed

- zc.ngi.async listeners didn't provide the real address when binding
  to port 0.

2.0.0a6 (2011-05-26)
--------------------

Bugs Fixed

- If application code made many small writes, each write was sent
  individually, which could trigger Nagle's algorithm.

2.0.0a5 (2010-08-19)
--------------------

New Features:

- Connection objects have a new peer_address attribute, which is
  equivilent to calling ``getpeername()`` on sockets.

Bugs Fixed:

- Servers using unix-domain sockets didn't clean up socket files.

- When testing listeners were closed, handle_close, rather than close,
  was called on server connections.

- The zc.ngi.async connections' ``write`` and ``writelines`` methods
  didn't raise errors when called on closed connections.

- The built-in connection adapters and handy adapter base class
  didn't implement __nonzero__.

2.0.0a4 (2010-07-27)
--------------------

Bugs Fixed:

- When using zc.ngi.testing and a server sent input and closed a
  connection before set_handler was called on the client, the input
  sent by the server was lost.

- By default, calling close on a connection could caause already
  written data not to be sent.  Now, don't close connections until
  data passed to write or writelines as, at least, been passed to the
  underlying IO system (e.g. socket.send).

  (This means the undocumented practive of sending zc.ngi.END_OF_DATA
  to write is now deprecated.)

2.0.0a3 (2010-07-22)
--------------------

Bugs Fixed:

- Fixed a packaging bug.

2.0.0a2 (2010-07-22)
--------------------

New Features:

- There's a new experimental zc.ngi.async.Implementation.listener
  option to run each client (server connection) in it's own thread.

  (It's not documented. It's experimental, but there is a doctest.)

Bugs Fixed:

- There was a bug in handling connecting to testing servers that
  caused printing handlers to be used when they shouldn't have been.


2.0.0a1 (2010-07-08)
--------------------

New Features:

- New improved documentation

- Support for writing request handlers in an imperative style using
  generators.

- Cleaner testing interfaces

- Refactored ``zc.ngi.async`` thread management to make the blocking
  APIs unnecessary. ``zc.ngi.async.blocking`` is now deprecated.

- Added support for running multiple ``async`` implementations in
  separate threads. This is useful in applications with fewer network
  connections and with handlers that tend to perform long-lating
  computations that would be unacceptable with a single select loop.

- Renamed IConnection.setHandler to set_handler.

- Dropped support for Python 2.4.

Bugs Fixed:

- The ``Sized`` request adapter's ``writelines`` method was broken.

- There we a number of problems with error handling in the ``async``
  implementation.

1.1.6 (2010-03-01)
------------------

Bug fixed:

- Fixed bad logging of ``listening on ...``. The message was emitted
  before the actual operation was successful.  Emits now a warning
  ``unable to listen on...`` if binding to the given address fails.

1.1.5 (2010-01-19)
------------------

Bug fixed:

- Fixed a fatal win32 problem (socket.AF_UNIX usage).

- Removed impropper use of the SO_REUSEADDR socket option on windows.

- The sized adapter performed poorly (because it triggered Nagle's
  algorithm).


1.1.4 (2009-10-28)
------------------

Bug fixed:

- Spurious warnings sometimes occurred due to a race condition in
  setting up servers.
- Added missing "writelines" method to zc.ngi.adapters.Lines.

1.1.3 (2009-07-30)
------------------

Bug fixed:

- zc.ngi.async bind failures weren't handled properly, causing lots of
  annoying log messages to get spewed, which tesnded to fill up log
  files.

1.1.2 (2009-07-02)
------------------

Bugs fixed:

- The zc.ngi.async thread wasn't named. All threads should be named.

1.1.1 (2009-06-29)
------------------

Bugs fixed:

- zc.ngi.blocking didn't properly handle connection failures.

1.1.0 (2009-05-26)
------------------

Bugs fixed:

- Blocking input and output files didn't properly synchronize closing.

- The testing implementation made muiltiple simultaneous calls to
  handler methods in violation of the promise made in interfaces.py.

- Async TCP servers used too low a listen depth, causing performance
  issues and spurious test failures.

New features:

- Added UDP support.

- Implementation responsibilities were clarified through an
  IImplementation interface.  The "connector" attribute of the testing
  and async implementations was renamed to "connect". The old name
  still works.

- Implementations are now required to log handler errors and to close
  connections in response to connection-handler errors. (Otherwise,
  handlers, and especially handler adapters, would have to do this.)

1.0.1 (2007-05-30)
------------------

Bugs fixed:

- Server startups sometimes failed with an error like::

    warning: unhandled read event
    warning: unhandled write event
    warning: unhandled read event
    warning: unhandled write event
    ------
