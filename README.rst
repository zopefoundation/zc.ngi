Network Gateway Interface
-------------------------

The Network Gateway Interface provides:

- the ability to test application networking code without use of
  sockets, threads or subprocesses

- clean separation of application code and low-level networking code

- a fairly simple inheritence free set of networking APIs

- an event-based framework that makes it easy to handle many
  simultaneous connections while still supporting an imperative
  programming style.
